## Project Summary
This project simulates 3000 supermarket transactions and applies the Apriori algorithm to mine frequent, closed frequent, and maximal frequent itemsets. Each itemset is evaluated based on support, and the results are saved into CSV files. Inline comments attribute contributions and explain logic step-by-step.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas mlxtend`
2. Open `frequent_itemsets_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter.
3. Run all cells to generate outputs.
4. Output files will be saved in the project root.
